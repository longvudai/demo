# ML Kit Text Recognition SDK Quickstart Sample App

## Introduction

This Quickstart app demonstrates how to use the GA version of Google ML Kit Text Recognition SDK in your app.

## Feature List

* [Text Recognition](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition/ios) - Recognize text in real time and static images

## Getting Started

* Run the sample code on your iOS device or simulator
* Try extending the code to add new features and functionality

## How to use the app

This app supports two usage scenarios: Live Camera mode and Static Image mode.

### Static Image Scenario
When the app is first opened, you will begin in Static Image mode. Use the carousel to select a specific API and hit “detect” to exercise the API on the preloaded images. In order to add your own images from the camera roll, select the camera roll icon on the top of the screen.

### Live Camera Scenario
This mode uses the camera preview as input instead of static images. In order to enter this mode, select the video camera icon in the top right corner of the screen.
